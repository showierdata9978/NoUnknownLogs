**Overview:**
The "NoUnknownLogs" mod is a handy utility for Minecraft players, especially those using MultiMC forks or dealing with log file limitations. This mod intelligently removes all instances of the term "unknown" from your Minecraft logs. By doing so, it ensures that your log files stay manageable and prevents them from filling up your hard drive with excessive data.

**Key Features:**

1. **Efficient Filtering:** NoUnknownLogs efficiently scans your Minecraft logs and removes all occurrences of the word "unknown" to keep your log files clean and concise.

2. **MultiMC Fork Support:** This mod is particularly useful for users of MultiMC forks, as these forks often have log file size limitations. NoUnknownLogs helps you stay within these limits by preventing unnecessary log entries.

3. **Hard Drive Space Savings:** By eliminating "unknown" entries from your logs, the mod helps you save valuable hard drive space, especially if you play Minecraft frequently or on a server with extensive log output.

**How It Works:**
NoUnknownLogs operates by intercepting log entries containing the term "unknown" and filtering them out before they are written to your log files. This ensures that your log files are free from redundant or uninformative entries, making it easier to troubleshoot issues and manage your logs effectively.
